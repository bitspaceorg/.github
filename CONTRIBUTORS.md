# Issues
Issues are raised when other developers find any error(s) in the source code, since raising bugs which the developer didnt find, by other developers, makes life easier in creating a stable project. 
Issues can be raised by first acknowledging them in the **Issues** panel of the repository. Once the developer reviews it, he may solve / he may assign it to other devs who requested for the same. You can also request an assignment of an issue to yourself, by mentioning the same.
