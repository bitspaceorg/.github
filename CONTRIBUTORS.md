# Proposal
The proposal should be in **Document format** ( .docx , .md , .pptx ) , and the number of pages should not exceed **10 pages**. The content should be brief , but at the same time , should also cover all the **vital points**.

#### Proposals should be submitted Through ðŸ“§ proposal@bitspace.org.in.

Every proposal must follow the structure as mentioned below :

- Title
- Origin of the Idea
- POC (Proof of Concept)
- One Liner
- Detailed Description
- Screenshots , Demo in form of Media ( optional )
- Assurance of Completion
- ETA of completion of Project

### Code of Conduct 
Every project must follow the [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/bitspaceorg/.github/blob/main/CODEOFCONDUCT.md) along with the above format mentioned. The project must not be an **already existing project in the Organization**. People who are interested in adding more features to existing projects can **contribute** to the same. 

### Documentation
The Project **MUST CONTAIN A README.MD file** with a clear and concise information about how to use the project , and a Documentation for the project covering all the objects , classes and data members which are to be informed. Projects with a illegible README.MD or documentation will be **REJECTED** irrespective of the Idea and Importance of the Project.

Being an Open-Source Organization , the firm accepts only public projects. No personal projects such as **Portfolio** , or Projects which are at elementary level, will be accepted.

### **Chances of Acceptance** also depend on Number of Commits 
Proposals with less number of commits having larger *diffs* will have **more chances of acceptance** then the ones with more number of commits having smaller *diffs*, since commiting very small changes (Except Issues) and Commit spams will usually be discouraged and will show up improper maintainence of source code.

# Pull Requests
Contributions to existing repositories are done by forking the repositories, commiting the changes and **creating a Pull Request (PR)**. Accepting pull requests are completely controled by the respective **Repository Owners** and ***not the Organization*** .

Guides on how to create a Pull Request
- [Pull Requests - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
- [Pull Requests - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/)

The Pull Request **must** contain the following contents
- Title : Should be small , yet descriptive Title 
- Description : Should contain a detailed description.
- Media :  Screenshots or Demo Videos

# Issues
Issues are raised when other developers find any error(s) in the source code, since raising bugs which the developer didnt find, by other developers, makes life easier in creating a stable project. 
Issues can be raised by first acknowledging them in the **Issues** panel of the repository. Once the developer reviews it, he may solve / he may assign it to other devs who requested for the same. You can also request an assignment of an issue to yourself, by mentioning the same.

Docs on Issues
- [Issues - Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
- [Search Tips : Issues - FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/github-search-tips/)

Issues must be ***structured*** and ***crystal clean*** , and must have the following contents
- **Error Description** : Describe the error with the source code snippet and suggest the solution too, if any
- **How to Reproduce** **\*** : Mention how to reproduce the code so that devs can generate the error for further development
- **Anything Else** : Contents to add as extras
